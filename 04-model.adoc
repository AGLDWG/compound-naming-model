== Model

This model is composed of Web Ontology Language (OWL) <<OWL>> Classes and Properties. Some of them are defined in this model and others are from other, well-known, ontologies and reused here. Each element indicates where it is defined using the _Is Defined By_ predicate.

[[Geocode]]
==== Geocode

[cols="2,6"]
|===
| Property | Value

| IRI | `:Geocode`
| Preferred Label | Geocode
| Subclass of | `geo:Geometry`
| Definition | A location with a role
| Is Defined By | This model
| Scope Note | Used to give additional location information for a name, beyond the spatial information associated with the object it is a name for
|===

[[ISAPronunciation]]
==== ISA Pronunciation

[cols="2,6"]
|===
| Property | Value

| IRI | `:ISAPronunciation`
| Preferred Label | ISA Pronunciation
| Definition | A textual datatype that uses ISA Pronunciation syntax
| Is Defined By | This model
| Sub-class Of | https://w3c.github.io/rdf-concepts/spec/#section-Datatypes[`rdfs:Datatype`]
| History Note | Create in this model
| Scope note | Use this to indicate that the object of the predicate `:hasPronunciation` uses ISA Pronunciation syntax
| Example | See example for <<hasPronunciation>>
|===

[[Resource]]
==== Resource

[cols="2,6"]
|===
| Property | Value

| IRI | `rdfs:Resource`
| Preferred Label | Resource
| Definition | The class resource, everything
| Is Defined By | https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf12-schema/[RDF 1.2 Schema]
| Scope Note | This class is used to represent both the things to which CompoundNames can be assigned and also the range value of the property rdf:value. It is not expected to be used directly but instead specialised types of Resource are expected
| Example | See the non-literal values for rdf:value in the CompoundName example
|===

[[Literal]]
==== Literal

[cols="2,6"]
|===
| Property | Value

| IRI | `rdfs:Literal`
| Preferred Label | Literal
| Definition | The class of literal values, eg. textual strings and integer
| Is Defined By | https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf12-schema/[RDF 1.2 Schema]
| Scope Note | This class is used to represent the range value of the property :asLiteral. It is not expected to be used directly but instead specialised types of Literal are expected
| Example | See the literals values of '72' and 'Yundah' in the CompoundName example
|===

[[Concept]]
==== Concept

[cols="2,6"]
|===
| Property | Value

| IRI | `skos:Concept`
| Preferred Label | Concept
| Definition | An idea or notion; a unit of thought
| Is Defined By | https://www.w3.org/TR/skos-reference/[SKOS Reference]
| Expected Properties | Standard SKOS properties for Concepts
| Scope Note | This class is the type of the expected values for the property sdo:additionalType when used within this model. Concepts are typically controlled terms within ConceptSchemes. Literal representations of Concepts should easily be obtainable
| Example
a| [source,turtle]

# See the example for CompoundName and add the following
#
PREFIX ex: <http://example.com/>
