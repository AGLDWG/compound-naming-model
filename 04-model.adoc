== Model

This model is composed of Web Ontology Language (OWL) <<OWL>> Classes and Properties. Some of them are defined in this model and others are from other, well-known, ontologies and reused here. Each element indicates where it is defined using the _Is Defined By_ predicate.

[[Resource]]
====

[cols="2,6"]
|===
| Property | Value

| IRI | `rdfs:Resource`
| Preferred Label | Resource
| Definition | The class resource, everything
| Is Defined By | https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf12-schema/[RDF 1.2 Schema]
| Scope Note | This class is used to represent both the things to which CompoundNames can be assigned and also the range value of the property rdf:value. It is not expected to be used directly but instead specialised types of Resource are expected
| Example | See the non-literal values for rdf:value in the CompoundName example
|===

[[Literal]]
====

[cols="2,6"]
|===
| Property | Value

| IRI | `rdfs:Literal`
| Preferred Label | Literal
| Definition | The class of literal values, eg. textual strings and integer
| Is Defined By | https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf12-schema/[RDF 1.2 Schema]
| Scope Note | This class is used to represent the range value of the property :asLiteral. It is not expected to be used directly but instead specialised types of Literal are expected
| Example | See the literals values of '72' and 'Yundah' in the CompoundName example
|===

[[Concept]]
====

[cols="2,6"]
|===
| Property | Value

| IRI | `skos:Concept`
| Preferred Label | Concept
| Definition | An idea or notion; a unit of thought
| Is Defined By | https://www.w3.org/TR/skos-reference/[SKOS Reference]
| Expected Properties | Standard SKOS properties for Concepts
| Scope Note | This class is the type of the expected values for the property sdo:additionalType when used within this model. Concepts are typically controlled terms within ConceptSchemes. Literal representations of Concepts should easily be obtainable
| Example
a| [source,turtle]
----
# See the example for CompoundName and add the following
#
PREFIX ex: <http://example.com/>
PREFIX skos: <http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#>

ex:Island
    a skos:Concept ;
    skos:inScheme ex:someConceptScheme ;

[cols="2,6"]
|===
| Property | Value

| IRI | `sdo:name`
| Preferred Label | name
| Definition | The name of the item
| Is Defined By | https://schema.org[schema.org]

[[hasPart]]
==== has part

[cols="2,6"]
|===
| Property | Value

| IRI | `sdo:hasPart`

[[value]]
==== value

[cols="2,6"]
|===
| Property | Value

| IRI | `rdf:value`
| Preferred Label | value
| Definition | Idiomatic property used for structured values
| Is Defined By | https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf12-schema/[RDF 1.2 Schema]
| Example | See the example for <<CompoundName>>
| Scope Note | Use this property to indicate the value of a CompoundName, whether it's a literal or a complex object
|===

[[additionalType]]
==== additionalType

[cols="2,6"]
|===
| Property | Value

| IRI | `sdo:additionalType`
| Preferred Label | additional type
| Definition | An additional type for the item, typically used for adding more specific types from external vocabularies
| Is Defined By | https://schema.org[schema.org]
| Example | See the example for <<CompoundName>>
| Scope Note | Use this property to indicate the specialised type of a part of a CompoundName
