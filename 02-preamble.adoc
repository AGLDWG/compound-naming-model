== Preamble

=== Abstract

A Semantic Web data model for complex labels may be assigned to geospatial features.

=== Namespaces

This model is built on a small set of well-regarded Semantic Web models which use a variety of namespaces. Prefixes for this namespaces, used throughout this document, are listed below.

=== Conformance

This model conforms to the https://w3id.org/profile/ontpub[OntPub Profile] which is a specification for ontology publication that mandates certain structural and metadata properties for the model as a whole and model elements. Metadata elements for the model as a whole - the ontology - are given in the <<Metadata>> section above.

==== Figures

Figures used in this document all use the key given in <<fig-overview, Figure 1>>.

==== Example Data
Example Data used in this document, for instance in model element "Example" values, are https://www.w3.org/RDF/[RDF] data in the https://www.w3.org/TR/turtle/[Turtle] syntax.

=== Model resources
