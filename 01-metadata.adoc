|**Provenance** | This model was made for Queensland Spatial Information, a unit of the Queensland Department of Resources, to assist with their future address and roads database design however, recognising the generic nature of this modelling, it was presented to the AGLDWG to be supplied as a "background model" for general use.

Changes were made in November 2025, to incorporate elements used in derived models, such as pronunciation, used in the Geographical Names Model, and Geocodes, used in the Address Model.
